# nest-book-example

## Setup database

Before using the project you have to setup a new database, for that you need to execute `psql` and then :   
`CREATE DATABASE nestbook;`  
`CREATE USER nest WITH PASSWORD 'nest';`

you can of course change all the naming and put the naming you want and store them as env variable until we add
the `.env` support
